## Analysis on air pollution in New-York City

### Description
Final project for my __Data Science for Business Analytics__ class.

The goal of this research is to assess levels of air pollution in New York City in regards to respective thresholds, given by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA (https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-pm) & the WHO, isolate the main drivers of air pollution, and finally investigate the disparities according to socio-economic factors.

### Data
Most of the datasets were gathered from the __NYC Open Data website__ (_https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/_). We used the __United Hospital Fund Neighborhoods__ as observations, which divide the city into 42 zones delimited by ZIP codes.

### How to run the project
To run the project, you need to download the _report_ and _scripts_ R files along with the _.Rproj_ file. All of the data can be found under the _data_ folder. The spatial data is needed to show the different maps of the UHF's across NYC ( used in the _analysis_ part and the Shiny app).
